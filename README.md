# Project Description: Shopping System

The Shopping System is a web-based application designed to facilitate shopping activities for users and provide administrative capabilities for managing products. The system allows users to log in as either a regular user or an administrator. New users have the option to create an account, and existing users can reset their passwords if they forget them.

As a user, you have the ability to browse and select items from a wide range of products. Upon selecting an item, you can specify the desired quantity. The system dynamically updates the database, deducting the selected quantity from the available stock. This ensures accurate inventory management and prevents overselling of products. Additionally, users can manage their personal information and track their order history.

Administrators have additional privileges, including the ability to add new products to the system. This enables them to expand the product catalog and keep it up to date with the latest offerings. Admins can also access and modify user information, enabling them to provide customer support and address any issues that may arise.

The Shopping System aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient shopping experience for customers while offering administrators the necessary tools to manage products and user accounts effectively. By incorporating essential features such as user authentication, account creation, password recovery, order management, and product administration, this project strives to streamline the e-commerce process and enhance customer satisfaction.

Overall, the Shopping System is a comprehensive solution that caters to the needs of both users and administrators, ensuring a seamless shopping experience and efficient product management.
